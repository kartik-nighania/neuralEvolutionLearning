# 3 MACHINE LEARNING NEURAL  EVOLUTION  ALGORITHMS  for    for SELF SUSTAINED GAME LEARNING such as MARIO
Neural Evolution through Augmented Topology (NEAT), 
 Hyper-NEAT and Conventional Neural Evolution (CNE) for NES emulator games. Games such as Super MARIO level 1 was learned and 
completed by the algorithm without any prior knowledge in 18 hours.
